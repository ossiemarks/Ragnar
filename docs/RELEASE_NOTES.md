# OptarisDefense Release Notes

---

## Unreleased — `releases` branch

### New Features

#### Interactive Network Map

- Zoom, pan, and drag support
- AI-assisted device classification via GPT-5 Nano toggle (optional, requires API key)
- Node labels prefer resolved hostname over raw IP
- Legend auto-generated from live data

#### Multi-Subnet Discovery
- Add extra subnets directly from the Network Map tab to discover devices behind other routers/APs
- Subnet scan log shows per-cycle progress
- Subnets persisted via `/api/config/scan-subnets` API

#### Unified Credentials Table
- Dedicated **Credentials** tab aggregating all discovered credentials across all services and networks
- Sortable columns (host, service, username, password, date)
- Full-text search/filter
- One-click CSV export

#### Per-Network File Browser
- Data stolen files and cracked passwords organised by SSID/network
- Network and SSID sorting/filtering in attack logs and file browser

#### Inline File Preview
- Preview text, CSV, and image files directly in the browser without downloading
- Scrollable modal with Escape and backdrop-click to close

#### HTML Scan Report Export
- One-click export of a full standalone HTML report containing hosts, credentials, and attack log
- Self-contained — no external dependencies, works offline

#### Pushover Push Notifications
- New `pushover_service.py` — sends real-time push notifications via the Pushover API
- Alerts for: new device discovered, device back online, new credentials found, new vulnerabilities
- Deduplication to avoid repeat alerts for known devices/events
- Configure API user key and app token in the web UI (Settings tab)
- Test notification button

#### Device Classifier
- New `device_classifier.py` — zero-dependency MAC OUI + open-port heuristic classification
- Sub-millisecond per-host classification, suitable for Pi Zero W2
- Categories: router, access-point, server, workstation, mobile, IoT, printer, camera, NAS, gaming, media, VoIP
- Optional AI enhancement for low-confidence devices

#### Environment Variable Manager
- New `env_manager.py` — manages API tokens (OpenAI key) in `.env` file with a clean Python API

### Improvements

- **Faster startup** — reduced boot time
- **E-paper display** — updated layout and rendering
- **Toggle switches** — corrected green background when enabled (was missing Tailwind class at runtime)
- **Search icon placement** — moved to right side in credentials and attack log search inputs, using inline styles to avoid Tailwind purge issues
- **Network storage** — per-network organisation for scan results and vulnerabilities
- **AI export button** — relocated for better UI flow
- **Scan progress** — more accurate progress counters via per-network result scoping

### Bug Fixes

- File preview modal: correct max height, `overflow-y-auto` on content, Escape and backdrop close
- Network map node labels now prefer hostname over IP
- Search icon visibility fixed with inline styles (bypasses compiled Tailwind)
- Attack log and file browser SSID/network sort and filter corrected

### 3. **Intelligent Hardware Detection**

#### **Automatic Server Mode Detection**
```
Hardware Requirements Check:
├─ RAM ≥ 8GB + NOT Pi Zero → Install Advanced Tools (automatic)
├─ Pi Zero W/W2 → Skip Advanced Tools (resource protection)
└─ RAM < 8GB → Skip Advanced Tools (informational message)
```

```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Check if advanced tools are available
python3 -c "from server_capabilities import get_server_capabilities; caps = get_server_capabilities(); print(f'Traffic Analysis: {caps.capabilities.traffic_analysis_enabled}'); print(f'Advanced Vuln: {caps.capabilities.advanced_vuln_enabled}')"
```

## 🔒 Security & Stability

### Resource Protection
- Pi Zero automatically excluded from memory-intensive operations
- Clear logging of hardware limitations
- Graceful degradation on resource-constrained systems

### GPIO Management

2. **Missing Module_Exit**: Added proper GPIO cleanup in detection loop
3. **Resource Detection**: Improved RAM calculation accounting for system overhead
4. **Package Fallbacks**: Enhanced multi-distro package name resolution

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible.

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing OptarisDefense Installations

**To enable advanced features:**
```bash
cd /home/optaris-defense/OptarisDefense
git pull  # Get latest code
sudo ./install_advanced_tools.sh
sudo systemctl restart optaris_defense
```

**Verify installation:**
