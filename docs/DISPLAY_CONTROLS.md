# Display Buttons & Joystick Reference

OptarisDefense's HATs carry hardware controls that change what they do depending on the
**mode** the display is in:

- **Default** — the normal OptarisDefense dashboard (the everyday screens).
- **Wardriving** — while the wardriving engine is running.
- **Network Diagnostic** — while `network_diagnostic_mode` is on (a standalone
  field tester; documented in full in the [Network Tools Guide](nettools.md#-on-screen-network-diagnostic-mode)).

Two HATs have controls:

- **2.7" e‑Paper HAT** — 4 keys (`KEY1`–`KEY4`).
- **1.44" ST7735S LCD HAT** — 3 keys (`KEY1`–`KEY3`) + a 5‑way joystick.

> The smaller square/OLED panels (GC9A01, SSD1306) have no onboard buttons.

## 2.7" e‑Paper HAT (4 keys)

GPIO pins (BCM), fixed by the HAT: `KEY1=5`, `KEY2=6`, `KEY3=13`, `KEY4=19`.
In Default and Wardriving layers the keys act **on press**.

### Default mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **KEY1** | Swap to/from **Pwnagotchi** (10 s cooldown) |
| **KEY2** | **Rotate / flip** the screen (0° → 90° → 180° → 270°) |
| **KEY3** | **Next page** — cycle through the OptarisDefense screens |
| **KEY4** | **Restart** the OptarisDefense service |

### Wardriving mode (engine running)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **KEY1** | Toggle a **phone-access AP** serving the minimal wardriving page |
| **KEY2** | **Rotate / flip** the screen |
| **KEY3** | Toggle the **live e‑paper map** (GPS track + network dots) |
| **KEY4** | **Connect** to a known Wi‑Fi (wardriving keeps running) |

### Network Diagnostic mode

Each key gains a **short** and a **long** (hold ~0.6 s) press — see the full
[field‑test key pad](nettools.md#field-test-key-pad-27-hat) table.

## 1.44" ST7735S LCD HAT (3 keys + joystick)

GPIO pins (BCM), fixed by the HAT: `KEY1=21`, `KEY2=20`, `KEY3=16`; joystick
`Up=6 Down=19 Left=5 Right=26 Press=13`.

> **Joystick orientation:** the joystick is physically mounted 90° clockwise of
> the panel's text, so OptarisDefense remaps every push into the frame **you read on the
> screen** — and re‑aligns automatically when **KEY2** rotates the display.
> The directions in the tables below are always relative to the upright text.

### Default mode

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Joystick ↑ / ←** | Previous display page |
| **Joystick ↓ / →** | Next display page |
| **Joystick press** | **Start / stop page autoscroll** — auto-cycle the pages every 5 s |
| **KEY1** | **Toggle On‑Screen Network Diagnostic Mode** |
| **KEY2** | **Rotate** the screen (0° → 90° → 180° → 270°) |
| **KEY3** short / hold | **Next page** / **restart** the OptarisDefense service |

> The e‑paper HAT uses KEY1 for the Pwnagotchi swap; on the LCD HAT KEY1 is the
> field‑tester switch instead — it flips Network Diagnostic Mode on and off.
> Autoscroll pauses automatically during Network Diagnostic mode and wardriving,
> and any manual joystick page-nav switches it off.

### Network Diagnostic mode

Navigated as **cards**: `LINK · IP · SWITCH · DHCP · WIFI · SIGNAL · SPECTRUM`.

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Joystick ← / →** | Previous / next **card** |
| **Joystick ↑ / ↓** | Cycle the highlighted **function** inside the card |
| **Joystick press** | **OK / select** — run the highlighted function (or dismiss a result) |
| **KEY1** | **Switch to OptarisDefense** — toggle the mode off |
| **KEY2** | **Card-selection menu** (press again to leave) |
| **KEY3** | **Pause / start auto-switch** — auto-cycle the cards every 5 s |

Pause auto-switch (KEY3) on the **WIFI** or **SIGNAL** card and it redraws
**every second** with live RSSI — SIGNAL's bars are refreshed by a fast passive
poll of just the listed APs' channels, so they move as you walk around.

Functions: **LINK/SWITCH** → Locate Port · L2 Health; **IP** → Ping GW · Ping
WAN · DNS Doctor · Speedtest; **DHCP/WIFI/SIGNAL** are read-only. On the
**SPECTRUM** card the ↑/↓ "functions" select the **band** (2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz) —
it draws that band's live **channel-occupancy spectrum** (a bar per channel,
height ∝ the strongest AP's signal, DFS/radar channels hollow, busiest channel
tick-marked) — the WiFi Spectrum Analyzer's Bar view on the panel. Press KEY3 to
freeze the auto-cycle, then ↑/↓ to sweep bands. It scans the **widest-band
adapter present** (so a tri-band dongle like the **Alfa AWUS036AXM** is used for
5/6 GHz instead of a 2.4-only onboard radio) and shows the scanned interface
name in the header — a band reads *"not supported"* when the chosen radio can't
reach it. See the full
[field‑test pad](nettools.md#field-test-pad-144-lcd-hat--joystick) table.

## Notes

- **Mode precedence:** Network Diagnostic mode takes over the keys/joystick while
  it's on; turning it off restores the Default (or Wardriving) behaviour.
- **Rotation:** `KEY2` cycles the screen rotation on both HATs. On the square
  128×128 LCD the panel realises two visual orientations (upright / 180°), and
  the joystick tracks whichever is shown.
- Headless installs (no display) accept the display toggles but have nothing to
  render on and no buttons to read.
