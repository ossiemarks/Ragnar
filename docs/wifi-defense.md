# 🛡️ WiFi Defense — 802.11 Frame Monitor / WIDS

A passive **wireless intrusion-detection system** built into OptarisDefense's web UI —
its own top-level **WiFi Defense** tab (next to *Network*). It listens on a
**monitor-mode** adapter for 802.11 management frames and flags the classic
Wi-Fi attacks a defender cares about.

> **Receive-only.** WiFi Defense never transmits a frame — it does not deauth
> attackers back, inject, or probe. It is a detection tool (a WIDS), not an
> attack tool. It complements the passive **[WiFi Analyzer](wifi-analyzer.md)**
> (which surveys the spectrum); this tab watches for *attacks*.

## What it detects

| Attack | What it is | How it's flagged |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Deauth / disassoc flood** | The 802.11 deauthentication DoS (`aireplay-ng`, `mdk4`): spoofed deauth/disassoc frames kick clients off an AP. | A burst of deauth/disassoc management frames; ≥ 15 in a window is called a **flood**. The **scope** (broadcast — to all clients — vs targeted), the dominant **reason code**, and the **Protected-Frame** posture are reported: an all-unprotected burst is a spoof, and aimed at a PMF/802.11w (6 GHz/WPA3) network it's an anomalous bypass attempt even though the frames are ignored. The attacker (transmitter) and target are listed. |
| **Beacon flood** | A storm of fake APs (`mdk3`/`mdk4` beacon mode, ESP32 spammers) — bogus SSIDs to drown the air or bait clients. | Two triggers. **(1) Randomized-BSSID burst** — mdk4's beacon mode emits random, **locally-administered** MACs, so a burst of ≥ 18 distinct BSSIDs whose **LA ratio ≥ 50 %** is a fake-AP storm (**critical**) even *below* the absolute count threshold. Ordinary neighbourhood density uses burned-in (global) MACs (~0 % LA) and stays quiet — so this is robust in dense RF without guessing a count. **(2) Absolute count** — distinct SSIDs ≥ a user-tunable threshold (default 100) or BSSIDs ≥ 150; a dense airspace over the threshold but with global MACs is a **warning** (unusually dense), not a critical storm. The capture's live SSID/BSSID counts **and LA ratio** are shown for calibration. |
| **Rogue AP / evil twin** | A look-alike AP advertising a **known** SSID from a BSSID that isn't yours, set up to harvest clients. | An SSID in the **trusted baseline** appearing from an untrusted BSSID → *evil twin*; or one SSID from ≥ 2 BSSIDs → *duplicate SSID* (set a baseline to confirm). |
| **KARMA / MANA** | An AP that answers probe requests for **many different SSIDs** — it pretends to be every network a client has ever joined. | A single BSSID that beacons/probe-responds for ≥ 5 distinct SSIDs. |

A big banner summarises the capture: **CLEAR**, **WARNING**, or **⚠ UNDER
ATTACK** (critical). Below it, one card per detection with the offending
BSSIDs/attackers, then frame counts and an inventory of every AP heard.

## Monitor mode (how it's set up)

WiFi Defense needs an adapter in **monitor mode**, configured with plain `iw`
(no `aircrack-ng` required):

- A **separate monitor vif** (`ragmon0`) is added on the adapter's radio (e.g.
  the **Alfa AWUS036AXM** / `mt7921u`). While monitoring, that adapter's
  **managed interface is brought down** — on a single-radio adapter a managed
  interface that stays up *holds the channel*, so the monitor can't be tuned
  (`iw set channel` → `EBUSY -16`) and hears nothing. Taking it down hands the
  radio to the monitor; **Disable monitor** brings it back up. Use the Pi's
  onboard Wi-Fi (or Ethernet) for connectivity while that adapter monitors.
  While monitoring, the adapter is also set **unmanaged in NetworkManager** (and
  `wpa_supplicant` released) so it isn't re-upped/reset under the monitor — the
  cause of `ragmon0` "disappearing" (ENODEV) right after a disable→re-enable.
  Disable re-manages it.
- If a concurrent vif can't be created/tuned, the adapter itself is switched
  into monitor mode (also off your network until you disable it; the UI warns).

The Pi's **onboard `brcmfmac` radio does not support monitor mode** at all, so
you need a capable USB adapter. **Enable monitor** sets it up; **Disable
monitor** restores the interface.

**Channel:** a monitor radio only hears one channel at a time. Leave the channel
box on **`hop`** to cycle the common 2.4/5 GHz channels during the capture
(catches attacks on any channel), or pin a specific channel number to dwell on
it (best when you already know where the attack is).

### Dedicated monitor (boot-time) — most robust

If you have an adapter you can **dedicate 100% to sniffing** (a spare USB dongle,
with the Pi's onboard Wi-Fi / Ethernet carrying connectivity), claim it as a
**dedicated monitor at boot** instead of toggling it from the web UI. The whole
interface is switched into `type monitor` (switch-mode) once, before the app
starts, so there is **no shared-radio vif, no runtime enable/disable dance, and
none of the EBUSY / "`ragmon0` disappeared" (ENODEV) failure modes**. WiFi
Defense then just captures on the already-monitor interface. The web UI detects
this and shows **"Dedicated monitor (wlan1) — boot-managed"** with the toggle
disabled (systemd owns the adapter).

Set it up (opt-in):

```bash
# 1. Try it once by hand (root):
sudo scripts/wifidef_dedicate.sh wlan1 US 2437 0
#      <iface> <regdomain> <init-freq-MHz> <six_ghz:0|1>

# 2. Make it persistent across reboots:
sudo cp scripts/optaris-defense-wifidef-monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo mkdir -p /etc/optaris_defense
sudo cp scripts/wifidef-monitor.env.example /etc/optaris_defense/wifidef-monitor.env
sudoedit /etc/optaris_defense/wifidef-monitor.env        # set WIFIDEF_IFACE=wlan1 etc.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now optaris-defense-wifidef-monitor
```

The unit runs **before** `optaris-defense.service` and, on stop/disable, hands the adapter
back to NetworkManager. Config lives in `/etc/optaris_defense/wifidef-monitor.env`:

| Var | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `WIFIDEF_IFACE` | the dedicated capture adapter (e.g. `wlan1`) — **not** the Pi's onboard `wlan0` |
| `WIFIDEF_REGDOMAIN` | 2-letter ISO regdomain (`iw reg set`) — needed to unlock 5 GHz DFS / 6 GHz |
| `WIFIDEF_INIT_FREQ` | MHz to park on at boot; the scan hopper retunes immediately |
| `WIFIDEF_SIX_GHZ` | `1` also hops 6 GHz — requires a Wi-Fi 6E radio (e.g. `mt7921u` / AXM) and a correct regdomain |

You can also run it directly: `python3 wifi_defense.py dedicate --interface wlan1
--regdomain US --init-freq 2437 [--six-ghz]`.

## Using it

1. Plug in a monitor-capable adapter and pick it in **Monitor adapter**.
2. **Enable monitor** (adds `ragmon0`, or switches the adapter). The **same
   button toggles it off** — it reads *Disable monitor (ragmon0)* while active.
   Enabling always rebuilds a **fresh, channel-primed** vif (tearing down any
   lingering one first), so disable→re-enable reliably comes back working rather
   than a vif that exists but hears nothing. Disabling also stops a running
   **Continuous** scan (otherwise its next loop would just re-enable monitor).
3. **Trust current APs** in a known-good environment — this **adds** the
   currently-shown APs to the SSID→BSSID baseline that powers **evil-twin**
   detection. It *accumulates* (union), so run it a few times / across a scan or
   two: a single capture window can't hear every BSSID of every SSID (dual-band
   radios, mesh nodes and band-steering publish one SSID from several BSSIDs),
   and any legit BSSID not yet trusted would otherwise be flagged as an evil
   twin. **Reset baseline** clears it to start over.
4. **Scan** for a capture window (default 15 s), or tick **Continuous** to
   re-scan on a loop as a live monitor — each capture starts only after the
   previous one finishes (no overlap). Hit **■ Stop** to end the loop.

## API & CLI

Detection-only; the only state written is the trusted-AP baseline.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/wifidef/interfaces` | wireless adapters + monitor capability + current monitor state |
| `POST /api/wifidef/monitor` | `{action: enable|disable, interface}` — set up / tear down monitor mode |
| `GET /api/wifidef/scan?interface=&seconds=&channel=` | capture window + WIDS analysis |
| `GET/POST /api/wifidef/baseline` | get / add-to (`{aps}` or capture) / `{action:clear}` the trusted SSID→BSSID baseline |
| `GET/POST /api/wifidef/thresholds` | get / set the beacon-flood thresholds (`{beacon_ssids, beacon_bssids}`) |
| `GET /api/wifidef/airtime?interface=&seconds=&channel=` | passive airtime / retry / PHY-rate / roaming diagnostics |
| `GET /api/wifidef/isolation?interface=&seconds=&channel=` | passive per-BSS client-isolation audit (+ mesh/ESS rollup) |
| `GET /api/wifidef/selftest` | parser + detector self-test |

## Airtime & link quality

A separate passive diagnostic (the "why is it slow" view). Capture all 802.11
frames — ideally on a **fixed channel** (airtime % is only meaningful when not
hopping) — and get, per AP: **airtime %** (estimated on-air time / capture time),
**retry rate** (retransmit flag), the **PHY-rate spread** (min/median/max Mbps),
plus **roaming churn** (clients re-associating/authing repeatedly). Findings flag
high retry (≥30%), airtime hogs (≥50%) and unstable roaming. Route
`GET /api/wifidef/airtime`; analysis is a pure function covered by selftest.

## Client isolation observer

A passive audit of whether an AP — or a whole mesh/ESS — actually enforces
**client isolation** (guest networks, hotel/office WLANs, IoT segments).
Encryption hides payloads, but the cleartext 802.11 header always reveals who
the AP is relaying frames *for*: a **ToDS** frame carries the wireless client
as SA, and a **FromDS** frame carries the original source as `addr3`. The
observer never transmits and never reads a payload.

Evidence collected per BSS over the capture window:

- **Peer relays** — the AP transmitted a unicast FromDS frame whose source is
  one of its *own wireless clients* and destination is another. That is the AP
  forwarding intra-BSS traffic: **isolation OFF** (verdict `open`), with the
  talking client pairs listed.
- **Broadcast relays** — the AP re-broadcast a client-originated broadcast
  (ARP and friends) into the cell: clients can at least discover each other
  (verdict `broadcast_open`).
- **Peer attempts / client broadcasts with no relay** — clients addressed each
  other (or broadcast repeatedly) yet the AP relayed nothing back: it is
  filtering (verdict `isolating`).
- Anything else — too little peer-directed traffic to judge (`no_evidence`).

Multi-node SSIDs get a **mesh/ESS rollup**: nodes grouped by SSID, plus
**cross-node forwarding** detection (a node airing traffic sourced from a
client that only ever appeared on a sibling node — mesh-wide isolation off
even when each node looks clean alone). 4-address **WDS/backhaul** frames are
counted as mesh-link evidence. Normal upstream traffic (wired-side sources
like the gateway) never counts against an AP.

Run it on a **fixed channel** (the channel of the AP/mesh under audit) —
catching a peer request *and* the AP's relay of it requires dwelling on the
BSS's channel; hopping yields only weak evidence. Route
`GET /api/wifidef/isolation`; `analyze_isolation()` is a pure function covered
by selftest (open / isolating / broadcast / mesh-cross-node cases, all
offline).

```bash
python3 wifi_defense.py interfaces
python3 wifi_defense.py monitor --interface wlan1 --enable
python3 wifi_defense.py scan --interface wlan1 --seconds 15         # or --channel 6
python3 wifi_defense.py baseline --interface wlan1 --seconds 20     # learn trusted APs
python3 wifi_defense.py isolation --interface wlan1 --seconds 30 --channel 6
python3 wifi_defense.py monitor --interface wlan1 --disable
python3 wifi_defense.py selftest
```

The self-test crafts real 802.11 frames with **Scapy** (deauth flood, 35-SSID
beacon flood, a 6-SSID KARMA AP, an evil twin, plus open / isolating /
mesh-cross-node client-isolation traffic), writes them to a pcap, then runs
the full parse → analyse pipeline and asserts each detection fires (and that
clean traffic stays **CLEAR**) — all offline.

Requires `iw` and **Scapy** (both installed by `install_optaris_defense.sh` /
`requirements.txt`).

## Troubleshooting

**"capture failed: … Errno 19 no such device" (ENODEV) / "ragmon0 is gone".**
The monitor vif named in the saved state (`ragmon0`) no longer exists — this
happens after a **reboot, a service restart, or the USB adapter being
unplugged/reset**, since the vif is not persistent but the bookmark is. This
breaks **both** the WIDS scan (AP/beacon-flood detection) *and* the
airtime/link-quality capture, because both need that monitor. Recovery is now
**automatic and two-layered**: Scan / Airtime verify the interface still exists
*before* sniffing (dropping a dead bookmark and re-enabling from scratch), and if
the vif dies *during* a capture they **rebuild it once and retry the capture** in
the same call. Continuous mode keeps looping through a recovery, so live
monitoring self-heals. If it still fails after that, **Disable monitor** then
**Enable monitor** to force a fresh vif. Your trusted-AP baseline and tuned
thresholds are preserved across all monitor bookkeeping.

*Why a **service restart** used to be the only thing that fixed it:* recreating
`ragmon0` (a disable→re-enable) gives it a **new kernel ifindex**, but the packet
library (scapy) caches the interface's old ifindex for the life of the process
and keeps binding the capture socket to the dead index → ENODEV on every scan —
until the process restarts and rebuilds that cache. OptarisDefense now **refreshes that
cache before every capture**, so a runtime re-enable heals just like a restart
(no `sudo systemctl restart optaris_defense` needed).

**Diagnosing a stubborn adapter — `scripts/wifidef_doctor.sh`.** When monitor
comes up but captures nothing (or a specific dongle misbehaves), run the doctor:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/wifidef_doctor.sh            # auto-detects the adapter
sudo ./scripts/wifidef_doctor.sh wlan1      # or name it explicitly
```

It records the environment (kernel, driver, `rfkill`, radio modes, code version
and **when the service last restarted** — a common gotcha after `git pull`),
then enables monitor through OptarisDefense's own code and compares an **OS-level
capture (`tcpdump`)** against OptarisDefense's capture on a channel that has traffic. The
contrast is the diagnosis: if `tcpdump` hears frames but OptarisDefense reports `frames=0`
the bug is in the capture path; if neither hears anything while `iw dev ragmon0
info` shows a real monitor channel, it's the driver/firmware. It also does a
disable→re-enable cycle and a manual vif rebuild, and dumps `dmesg`. Everything
is saved to `/tmp/wifidef_doctor_*.log` to paste into a bug report.

## Standalone deep monitor — `wifiwatch`

For a continuous, daemon-shaped monitor beyond the capture-window WIDS above —
raw-byte 802.11 parsers, a warmup census, per-scope refractory alerting,
JSON-lines output, pcap `--replay`, an ambient-calibration tool, and a hardened
systemd unit — see **[wifiwatch](wifiwatch.md)** (`python3 python/wifiwatch.py`). It
shares the LA-ratio beacon-flood and deauth scope/PMF logic documented above.
