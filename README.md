OptarisDefense is a fork of the awesome [Bjorn](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn) project — a Tamagotchi-like autonomous network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and offensive security tool. It runs on a **Raspberry Pi** with a 2.13-inch e-Paper HAT, as a **headless server** on Debian-based systems (AMD64/ARM/ARM64) with Ethernet-first connectivity, or on the **WiFi Pineapple Pager** with full-color LCD display. On servers with 8GB+ RAM, OptarisDefense unlocks advanced capabilities including real-time traffic analysis and enhanced vulnerability scanning.

## 🌐 Web Interface

Access OptarisDefense's dashboard at `http://<optaris-defense-ip>:8000`

- Real-time network discovery and vulnerability scanning
- Multi-source threat intelligence dashboard
- File management with image gallery
- System monitoring and configuration
- Hardware profile auto-detection (Pi Zero 2W, Pi 4, Pi 5)

**WiFi Configuration Portal** — When OptarisDefense can't connect to a known network, it creates a WiFi hotspot:
1. Connect to WiFi network `OptarisDefense` (password: `optaris_defenseconnect`)
2. Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1:8000`
3. Configure your WiFi credentials via the mobile-friendly interface
4. OptarisDefense will automatically retry known WiFi after some time if the AP is unused
5. Once configured, OptarisDefense exits AP mode and connects to your network

The portal supports network scanning with signal strength, manual entry for hidden SSIDs, known network management, and one-tap reconnection.

web will be down during wardrive without ap or wifi connection.

## 🌟 Features

- **RuSense — Camera-Free Surveillance** — Turns ordinary 2.4 GHz WiFi into a no-camera sensor: ESP32 nodes read Channel State Information (CSI) to report presence, motion, people-count, and — with a trained model — coarse pose and resting vital signs (breathing / heart rate). Works in the dark and through walls, with security & health modes, a calibration wizard, browser flashing, and a multi-node offline mesh. See [RuSense](#-rusense--camera-free-surveillance)
  
- **Authority Verification Across the Stack** — A built-in engine for verifying authority at every layer — is the claimed root bridge / default gateway / DNS resolver / DHCP server / routing neighbour / name responder / SMB server genuine, or an impostor? — plus a network engineer's toolbox, in the web UI across three tabs. **Diagnostics:** ping, traceroute, MTR, WHOIS, internet speed test, DNS Doctor, ARP-poisoning / MITM detection, MAC Watch, Path-MTU / black-hole probe, captive-portal check, iperf3 throughput, Live Flow Telemetry, PTP-timing detection, and **IPv6 RA Guard** (audits + one-click hardens the host's IPv6 first-hop settings — ICMPv6-redirect and rogue-RA-preference exposure) — plus an opt-in **Network Integrity Monitor** that reruns the DNS-poison / ARP-spoof / rogue-DHCP / RA-Guard checks on a schedule and, with **extended monitoring**, round-robins the entire passive-scanner suite (STP/DTP/CDP/VTP/FHRP/OSPF/EIGRP/IS-IS/BGP/SMB/Relay/LDAP/IGMP/IPv6/NDP/ICMP/NTP/SNMP/Cert/TLS) through the background poller, Pushover-alerting on any regression — capture-based scanners default to a **link-up wired port** (pinnable per config), so a sensor plugged into a switch but managed over WiFi watches the cable, not `wlan0`. **Switch & L2/L3:** LLDP/CDP/EDP/FDP/SONMP switch discovery with PoE, ARP host scan, DHCP Guardian (with an inline DHCP-snooping mode), L2 link health, plus a **detection-only passive security-scanner suite spanning L2→L7** — **IGMP · IPv6 First-Hop · NDP (IPv6 neighbor-cache poisoning) · NTP · ICMP · SNMP · STP/BPDU · DTP · CDP (Cisco Discovery flood/spoof/leak) · VTP (VTP-bomb / VLAN-DB wipe) · SMB (SMBv1 + LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS poisoning + Kerberos downgrade/roasting) · Relay/Coercion (NTLM relay + PetitPotam/PrinterBug/DFSCoerce) · LDAP (Active Directory — cleartext binds, StartTLS strip, enumeration, filter injection, CLDAP reflection) · FHRP (HSRP/VRRP/CARP + GLBP AVG *and* AVF forwarder-plane hijack) · EIGRP · IS-IS · OSPF · BGP** Watch and a **receive-only BGP collector + path-asymmetry** correlator — a **TLS Watch** passive TLS/QUIC handshake observer (JA4/JA4_r + JA3/JA3S fingerprints, SNI/ALPN, SNI↔cert mismatch, QUIC v1/v2 Initial recovery), the active **Cert Watch** certificate/hygiene checker (plus a passive, standalone **[certwatch](docs/certwatch.md)** that triages observed X.509 certs off a tap/SPAN — expiry, name-mismatch, weak-sig/key — and inventories TLS 1.3 flows whose cert is encrypted), a PCAP analyzer, and Locate Port. Every scanner learns a baseline, ships a CLI, and self-tests (Scapy / local-handshake end-to-end). **Interfaces:** link speed/duplex/auto-neg, DHCP-vs-static + VLAN, DNS/gateway identity, per-interface public-IP / ISP-ASN lookup, and a VPN-egress check. Missing CLI tools install with one click. Co-authored by [Solarflere](https://www.instagram.com/solarflere). **Full details in the [Authority Verification Guide](docs/nettools.md).**


- **WiFi Spectrum Analyzer** — A passive, tri-band (2.4/5/6 GHz) Wi-Fi RF troubleshooter in the web UI (**Network → WiFi Analyzer**), a software take on the [Ekahau Sidekick](https://www.ekahau.com/products/sidekick/). **Strictly passive** — it only listens for beacons (`iw scan passive`) and never transmits a probe to any AP. A big center spectrum graph with two views — **Bar** (bar per AP, width = channel width, height = RSSI) and **Cone/Dome** (the classic filled bell-curve per AP) — shows every BSS with RSSI, channel + width, SSID, security and AP-advertised channel utilisation. Flags **co-/adjacent-channel interference** with 1/6/11 recommendations, shades **DFS/radar** channels (read live from the radio), estimates an AP's **coverage radius** (log-distance path-loss rings), and builds a **walk-around coverage heatmap** (floorplan + IDW interpolation on a true-to-scale square plan with **metre rulers, adjustable floor size and zoom/pan** — from a 10 m² room to a 300+ m² office). Bands are detected per-radio; tuned for the **Alfa AWUS036AXM** (Wi-Fi 6E, `mt7921u`) on a Pi Zero 2 W. See [WiFi Analyzer Guide](docs/wifi-analyzer.md)

- **WiFi Defense (802.11 WIDS)** — A passive **wireless intrusion-detection** monitor in its own web-UI tab. Listens on a **monitor-mode** adapter for 802.11 management frames and flags **deauth/disassoc floods** (the classic Wi-Fi DoS), **beacon floods** (fake-AP storms), **rogue APs / evil twins** (a known SSID from an untrusted BSSID, against a trusted baseline), and **KARMA/MANA** rogue APs (one BSSID answering many SSIDs). **Receive-only** — it never transmits a frame or deauths back. Monitor mode is set up with plain `iw` (a separate `ragmon0` vif where the driver allows, keeping your link up; else a mode switch) — **no aircrack-ng dependency**; Scapy captures with optional channel-hopping. Shows a CLEAR/WARNING/UNDER-ATTACK banner, a card per detection with attacker/BSSID detail, and an AP inventory. Includes a passive **client-isolation observer**: from cleartext 802.11 headers alone it audits whether an AP or mesh actually enforces client isolation (guest/IoT WLANs) — flagging APs seen relaying client-to-client traffic (OPEN), silently filtering it (ISOLATING), plus mesh-wide **cross-node forwarding**. Needs a monitor-capable adapter (e.g. the Alfa AWUS036AXM). See [WiFi Defense Guide](docs/wifi-defense.md)

- **Wardriving with GPS recovery** — Logs WiFi networks, BLE devices, and cell towers with GPS positions while driving. Exports to WiGLE CSV / KML. Most wardrivers log observations with GPS-at-scan-time and discard the rest; OptarisDefense logs a GPS breadcrumb track during the session and runs a post-pass that backfills missing positions for any observation seen within 5 minutes of a real GPS point. The interpolation is speed-aware — when endpoint speeds differ (slowing for a tunnel, accelerating out the far side), it uses constant-acceleration math instead of constant-velocity, shifting positions toward whichever endpoint the device actually spent more time near. See [Wardriving Guide](docs/wardriving.md)

## 📡 RuSense — Camera-Free Surveillance

RuSense turns ordinary 2.4 GHz WiFi into a **no-camera surveillance** system for home,
office, and anywhere a lens is unwelcome. ESP32 sensor nodes read **WiFi Channel State
Information (CSI)** — the tiny distortions a moving body imprints on radio waves — and a
bundled sensing engine reports **presence, motion, people-count**, and (with a trained
model) **coarse pose and resting vital signs**. No images are ever captured; it works in
the dark and through walls.

- **Flash a sensor node from your browser** — no toolchain needed: **[RuSense Flasher](https://pierregode.github.io/OptarisDefense/)** (ESP32-S3 DevKitC / Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 & Plus / AMOLED / C6, Chrome/Edge).
- **Install the backend:** `sudo ./scripts/install_sensing.sh` (runs as `optaris-defense-sensing.service`).
- **View it** under the RuSense tabs in the web dashboard at `http://<optaris-defense-ip>:8000`.

## 🐝 OptarisDefense + Pwnagotchi Side by Side

A bundled helper script plus dashboard controls make swapping between OptarisDefense and Pwnagotchi painless:

1. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   cd /home/optaris-defense/OptarisDefense
   sudo ./scripts/install_pwnagotchi.sh
   ```
   The script clones [pwnagotchiworking](https://github.com/PierreGode/pwnagotchiworking) into `/opt/pwnagotchi`, installs dependencies, writes `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml`, and drops a disabled `pwnagotchi.service`. Re-running is fast — it skips already-installed packages.

2. Open the web UI → **Config** tab → **Pwnagotchi Bridge** → click **Switch to Pwnagotchi**.

**Requirements:**
- USB WiFi adapter (wlan1) with monitor mode support
- Waveshare 2.13" e-Paper HAT V4 for the pwnagotchi face display

**Pwnagotchi web UI:** `http://<same-ip>:8080` (credentials: `optaris_defense` / `optaris_defense`)

**What the installer configures:**
- Monitor mode scripts (`/usr/bin/monstart`, `/usr/bin/monstop`)
- e-Paper display type (`waveshare213_v4`) and rotation
- Web UI on port 8080, Pwngrid disabled
- RSA keys, log directories, bettercap integration

**Swapping via PiSugar 3 button:**

| Button Action | While OptarisDefense is running | While Pwnagotchi is running |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Single tap | Toggle manual mode | — |
| Double tap | Switch to Pwnagotchi | Switch to OptarisDefense |
| Long press | Switch to Pwnagotchi | Switch to OptarisDefense |

A 10-second cooldown prevents accidental double triggers. If PiSugar is not connected, the listener is silently disabled.

**Static IP recommended:** When switching modes, WiFi may briefly reconnect with a different DHCP IP. Set a static IP:

```bash
sudo nmcli con mod "YOUR_WIFI_SSID" ipv4.method manual \
  ipv4.addresses "192.168.1.211/24" \
  ipv4.gateway "192.168.1.1" \
  ipv4.dns "192.168.1.1"
sudo nmcli con up "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
```

Or set a DHCP reservation on your router. This only affects wlan0 — the monitor interface (wlan1/mon0) is not changed.

**Service recovery:** If OptarisDefense doesn't start after a reboot:
```bash
sudo /home/optaris-defense/OptarisDefense/scripts/fix_services.sh
```

- Graphical startup menu with interface selection and Web UI toggle
- Auto-dim for battery saving and payload handoff support

**Installation:**

Option A — From the main installer (select option 3):
```bash
sudo ./install_optaris_defense.sh
# Choose: 3. Install on WiFi Pineapple Pager
```

Option B — Direct deployment:
```bash
./scripts/install_pineapple_pager.sh [pager-ip]
```

**Usage:**
1. Launch from Pager menu: **Reconnaissance > PagerOptarisDefense**
